Wow, it’s been awhile. 

I didn’t really intend to stop posting for five years now, but that’s always how it goes. Between day-to-day concerns and work, we sometimes get lost.

So, I’m getting this post out of the way and can return to posting again. I have made a lot of changes to this blog, the main change is the switch of the SSG engine to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) combined with Github pages and Github actions. 

I added the light and dark mode and removed all the social media crap and analytics.

You can find the code on [Github](https://github.com/daker/daker.github.io).
