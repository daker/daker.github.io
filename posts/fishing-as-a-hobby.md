Last month i started taking up fishing as a hobby, it's a wonderful outdoor pastime and a great way to relax and unwind. One of the best things about fishing is that you don't need expensive equipment, i did bought some amateur fishing gear(from Avito) to start with(3 rods 5m, 270 & 240cm).

Until now i haven't caught any fish yet, i learned a lot since i started practicing and i am still trying to find a good spot where i can fish and charge my batteries during the week-end.
