Slack is a great platform for team communication, it is a collection of chat rooms, both public and private. It helps confine all your team communications to one place. Slack also provides an API to let you interacte with it, so i have to decided to write a simple app using Flask to integrate Slack with Launchpad using its new webhooks feature.
